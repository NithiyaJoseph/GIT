#Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps (global link)- https://dev.azure.com
Azure - It is the product of Microsoft
Azure DevOps platform - It is an PAAS(Platform as a Service)
SAAS - 
IAAS -
Azure Devops-->organisation-->projects-->Repos?
Repo/Repository - whenever the developers create their code in local like visual studio they push/store their code in a common repository here we are using a private repository as azure repo.
To send the code from local to remote - git commands
To develop your code - you require a platform for that we use visual studio code --> download from google

#Actual working:
azure repos--> Repository(project A) client has given you
you have to create branches
by default main branch will be created along with the repo --> main production code will be stored
you can also create master branch to store your prod code

#creation of feature branch
why feature branch --> To create new features or updation
1) feature branch is created based out of main branch
2) clone your remote code to the local (git bash, vs code) there is an option as clone icon-->click it -->clone in vs code-->open in vs code-->in your local create a new folder and then save it
3) In VS code go to file-->open folder--> make your code changes-->then open terminal by clicking view option in vs code or click on the thrid icon button on top
cd reponame/path (change directory)
#basic git commands
1) git status --> it will show what are the changes i have made to my code
for that git should be downloaded in vs code --> go to extensions on left side -->search for git it will display gitlens or gitKraken after that do git config steps
2) git add . --> adding our changes
3) git commit -m "your message what you have committed"
4) git push origin <branchname> 

Environments :
Usually in a project there will be commonly three environments or 4 according to their project
All the development code will happen in DEV environment
All the developed code will be tested in PRE-PROD/QA environment
All the tested code will be moved to PRODuction environment
In some projects there will be UAT environment - User Acceptance Testing
